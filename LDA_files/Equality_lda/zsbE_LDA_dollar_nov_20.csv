For example, Black entrepreneurs receive less financial support (and face other systemic barriers), so they succeed less, so they are seen as less likely to succeed and thus not worthy of equal financial support (much less the extra financial support they might need to overcome those other systemic barriers)."

R_0ODOGuPQeKqwhIB,5e27616fe837f399dc3fe42f,"I think the biggest barrier is the fact that the system/unchecked capitalism rewards those who are already rich and influential.

People who have previously experienced special treatment are accusing others of demanding special treatment because programs are explicitly naming targeted recipients while society in large part avoids naming or referencing the bias the program is designed to combat. For example, affirmative action is often discussed as preferential treatment of minority applicants instead of being framed as a program which addresses existing preferential treatment of white applicants (which is more accurate and avoids placing the burden on minorities to defend themselves against systemic bias that our culture avoids admitting existence of).
