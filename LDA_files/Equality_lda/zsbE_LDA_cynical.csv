R_3Dkoc0dXmRR4Xih,5e2e4ff27916f0433760d72a,"Racial equality is an an achievable goal, granted there is no precedent for it.  The United States represents the most diverse country in the world, and are pioneering the path towards complete racial equality."
R_2s6IHWMhuwWgcHT,5685850c333cbd000d4e042f," Equality can be achieved, but it must start with changing how racist people feel about black people. Once that's over, we will be closer to true racial equality."
R_2dT8l3kdAmjKvhW,5b197b8088ee7400012ae154,racial equality can exist with the change of thoughts and actions from the government 
R_RF9tArMPQmhzyxP,5596fc41fdf99b4a8bd2d4eb,"Equality can definitely be achieved, but it will take some people acknowledging that they benefit from white privilege and actively working against it."
R_290ux87LpFGybPy,5dcca2db88381e92c96b9ac5,I would like to think equality can be achieved. I just don’t know how. There are so many layers to inequality in the U.S based on many different factors. 
R_3oSn3lzeBEDGhFc,5e54548b20410b45b084a230,"Racial equality can be found. When Americans are racist, it's because of preexisting conditions. We can fix those conditions"
R_3sdDn91WS6nMmbm,5d37de63b78497001ad6b44b,"Equality can't be achieved because in order to please one set you hurt another. For instance I do think All Lives Matter, but that is a racist thing to say in light of Black Lives Matter. Which means I'm not putting blacks before all. When did I ever say white lives matter, more than all?"
R_TcMGL1N1ogzRzZn,5df967d2f6191f6e87b236e6,"It can be achieved, but it really depends on how people act on it. Not only others but also the black community"
R_29gGyYJaxNwWYua,5ae7f99bd5ec5e000175f097,"I think we can be equal someday. It will always take time to get there, and these peaceful protests will keep it going."
R_3iCCXrneTSP1LGP,566a19b57da035000fb39b89,You can't force someone to change their behaviors. If anything by being too aggressive it will only lead to more resentment. The path is to gradually do it.
R_3hotr4zNrbpB3BH,5dcf74ce3683dc0ae942a1e4,equality can be achieved in the US but it wont happen overnihgt- it takes time and protests. it takes people from all aspects of life with all types of backgrounds to make a change 
R_3GkRLlBhuuKWNWz,5c23c03889f035000173d7d7,"Equality is not impossible. We need to adress the issue, and then correct it."
R_2Ugxvg6CQo9u9gj,5e67c0f32db3660689d17eeb,"I think there will always be disenfranchised people, even if it transcends race."
R_1k0m0hJDx1zbD8m,5ca229d63861e700154363bd,"Unfortunately, the situation is hopeless. Paradoxically, the more successful Black Lives Matter is, the more race conscious white people will become. And when white people become more race conscious..."
R_1YAdAR6iX1x192F,5dd2e29b2c5c102e6454227a,"I want to believe it is something that can be achieved, but it is so far beyond the color differences. It is the income gap, the divide between rich and poor, that it truly the basis on inequality. This dems vs republicans and black vs white is just a ploy to keep the masses from seeing it is us, the 99.9%, vs them, the 0.01%. "
R_1pn8COij18vnzKU,5dd446ab87c1fd43fbb49aa1,"As younger people replace older generations, I believe racial equality will become more equal."
R_6tVWMuNwYLcsfdf,5c468991016e2f00017e96e8,"I don't believe that perfect equality can be achieved because a few people will always be greedy. However, I believe that we can constantly improve in that respect."
R_3Huj72T8m8EU67x,5e1ba7e1085a1c3dd2db39fc,"Equality can be achieved in the United States, but it is not going to be an overnight fix. Systemic racism exists in the U.S., so equality is going to involve the reform of many of our biggest institutions as well as the education of individuals"
R_vCdK5qAVEBfCkLv,5e7bc10939f0d10b16c5f79b,"I believe that racial equality can be achieved in all societies on the surface but that in some communities or some people it is something that will be hard to overcome since some people can't see beyond the hate they were taught. Also sometimes the groups of people have directly hurt the other group in some manner and that is hard to overcome sometimes. If people chose to be open-minded I think there is a possibility we could become a more equal society, although it may take longer than most people want. "
R_1ON36gnR3e48six,5e3d8f6b6b1c15033ce417f4,"there's never been a point in us history where equality, especially racial equality, has actually and truly existed. it's gotten closer in many cases, but it's difficult to tell whether or not it is technically impossible (considering how humans are inherently flawed people and thus create and perpetuate broken systems) at this point in time. even still, i am optimistic."
R_2frhAyWL7qz8yBf,5d72e994d259c60018062727,"I'd say equality could be achieved in the US. Not within the next year, but possibly in the future."
R_2zcHlmen5xaHGL7,5e84c49534d5d90891d74dc6,Racial equality can be achieved if our leaders/government make it a priority.  Policy and legal changes have to occur.
R_XiIAw94hJDZqqtz,5dd5e27fe25acf59990e1adf,equality can be achieved through education and more time as relations improve over generations.
R_3rOM5BDgjoDsHmk,5d30e5f3e057f0001724501e,I think it can be achieved with a lot of focus and work towards racial equality.  
R_dhbUw6UTNcTPULn,5d0c10124b68150015fd5bca,"There is a racial divide in American society that has always been there and will likely stay. I've learned better than to trust people, especially different races."
R_1jk1qDstnL1PPE8,5e793dd0f855e84f6acc41dc,"I think that in terms of social attitudes and interactions, inequality will always exist to some extent. However, the status of disadvantaged groups can be elevated through economic policy."

R_1IKGmpAFSIf3wEe,5ddcbca2798297c203d13723,Racial inequality has existed for 100's of years and despite the fact that progress has been made over the last 100 years the racial divide still exists.  It's something that gets passed on through generations and I don't believe it's something that can ever go away as there will always be groups of people who feel they are superior to others.  
R_8hNAJ9NRYjfDWUx,5eb957ce613bbd028a1bf032,Racial equality can always be achieved. Previously in the US we used to discriminate against the Irish and Italians as well as any immigrants from eastern Europe and that has largely gone away.
R_2nrkMUaHosh7byN,5c76ed4a909522000114e278,I think it can be achieved but it will take a long time to undo the way our systems have been already built.
R_1f8DzyxMJAfOqBN,5d158eb140218700189a0779,"In a perfect world, racial equality could be achieved, but there needs to be so much more improvement before we can even talk about perfect racial equality."
R_2BfzESLqYUWCiWZ,56a8c83f7f2472000c9445d6,"I dont think it is human nature.  The black issue,.  Now whites are getting repercussion.  "
R_2q9KrE4aAgpkN5w,5aea77d444277c000101c508,"I'd like to think that humans are capable of creating just and equal societies, but we continue to fail at it, leaving little room for optimism."
R_TnkWFIpGdxP7z7r,5c6b2f0d5b27b00001a3561f,Equality is possible to achieve. It is less likely to be achieved in America because there is a massive disconnect between the ruling class and the people most affected by inequality here.
R_1dzzygYwWpGD0ym,5c6e2e85806b55000119d515,"I struggle with knowing fully how I feel about this. As a believer, I do believe there will always be sin in the world until Jesus comes back... but that doesn't mean we stop trying to be more like Him."
R_3MssPQ8pNmxCDA7,5e31978166f7ac184c52c457,"I see a lot of people talking about how they support ""peaceful"" protest, or they support the cause but don't support the looting or setting things on fire. It's easy to recognize there's a problem, but not do anything about it because you are not the one affected. /  / As soon as you are affected by looting, by a fire, by a curfew, by a street being shut down, by your work being closed, by some type of injustice you did not personally deserve, regardless of how little, then maybe you can have a little understanding or compassion for what black Americans face daily leading all the way up to losing their life for no reason other than being black. /  / Black Americans are targeted daily for just being black by security guards, store employees, gas station attendants, co-workers, strangers, police officers or by so-called good samaritans with a gun utilizing stand your ground laws designed to help people kill other people (really that list can go on and on). It's not just this one incident it is so many others combined. /  / The marching, protest, rioting, looting, and setting things on fire are all a symptom of a larger problem that we have in America. That is racism, oppression, and police brutality. The people that are willfully ignorant and the people that are racist by their actions and don't even know it."
R_UEDWY4p1d22MlRD,5da8d4ea813dc400156b8cbf,"I believe that we have come a long way in the past 240 years. I believe that being born in America is such a gift. We are free. We have such privileges that we don't even comprehend we have because we choose ignore our privilege. All of us as Americans are privileged. There will always be sin in this world. There will be hate, murder, racism of all kinds. However, to blame systemic racism as the root of all your problems isn't real either. "
R_2DYt5T3SBX42CDx,5e9de42d6af8f2148b67cbb6,"I don't think racism can fully be solved because as long as we keep discussing the differences between races people are going to be born with a natural liking to a group. But if we stopped discussing races then people might eventually just see it as like a hair color, as in it really doesn't make a difference. But because we are continuously talking about race I think we are making progress, but that initial wedge between the races will always persist. "
R_24xbx0lA6TFenQk,571dfc5913b1b70009be337f,Equality was never meant to be achieved at a economic level and I am think that people will always see different races different then each other.  
R_3KBGQyZqbbtBSQm,5e5080883771350caf2d9fda,"I feel like as we watch the world today, nothing has changed much when it comes to racism. The problem is that as a whole, people from all different societies and races have people that are racist and I don't have a lot of faith that it will ever change. I have experienced racism towards me many times and my skin color is white, and I have seen racism towards people of all colors many times as well. Racism knows no color, it's just pure ignorance from any group of people. The problem truly is the hate in society as a whole and that people tend to fight fire with fire. "
R_3PuhnxzcyiqkHG2,5b5a822e1ad8270001c4f28d,We all must have equal opportunities in America. No one shouldn't be put down because their color of skin. No one should be say you aren't qualify of the job because of your race. We are all the same and must be treated with respect. It's the right thing to do. 
R_2QGxz2t21QGB1LO,5d25336d3e31ad0016186262,The efforts needed to achieve often need one or two seminal events to get them going.  We appear to now be at that place in the US. 
R_DwALl4PsZFg0yMF,5c01dc58067bbf00019bb318,"Racial and social equality can be achieved in the US, but it will be a long, slow process.  There will be setbacks along the way due to differing political agendas, but I view the process as a two steps forward, one step back process."
R_1nNLLmIRWoXBSsA,5d2e35286835130019aa16fb,There will always be racism/prejudice in society. Some people just cannot be changed and don't want to be changed. I think it will make gains over time but will be slow to change. Continued protesting is great. Throwing money at things won't bring about the change that is needed right away.
R_O99xBXeL6EoHJiV,5d74001d391b6600175f433b,"There is so much more we can do in this country to achieve racial equality. There will probably always be pockets of racism and some intractable discrimination that will take generations to heal, but we can set up systems to prevent those factors from having influence. /  / Equality in general is complex. I don't think it's possible to achieve total equality (such as income, housing, healthcare, education, power, influence, etc.) but there are a lot more things we can do to get closer to that ideal."
R_3O2Z7wK3IaTFaWa,5d6048d1a57d77001e8950e1,I think racial equality can be achieved in American and in society as a whole.  Everyone should be fighting for racial equality no matter what race they are.
R_2s1G9o3HLRuaSzR,5cb647faf05de00017e16534,"It can definitely be achieved, though I am not certain how we do it. Our current administration is definitely a roadblock against equality and progress. I'm not sure how change will be achieved. As a white woman, I find it's best to listen, as I am not sure how I can affect change. "
R_210nzuYjQRtcPuB,5ea47bda5b1a9807ed89eb76,"My age is 73 and I came of age in the 1960s.  I have lived through this kind of thing many times now and have witnessed the advance and decline of humanity over and over, but have seen very little change.  I am tired and frustrated and have mostly given up.  The advance of humanity/civilization is a nasty, messy business and is a long, long game.  I am leaving it for those with more energy."
R_3345rZAznE9ygRQ,5dd9e1e0a4aa2696d9a15c0d,"it would be very difficult for this to happen as US societal framework has been established over hundreds of years. All races should have the chance if they work hard and are honest, decent people,  to have a good life here in the US."
R_2zd6pqNHnHy9htw,5da90d2016274d0015cfe3de,"Note: I want to qualify some of my answers about my coworkers/workplace/job but explaining that I'm not currently working, and I'm slated to start a new job in the fall, so there haven't been many opportunities for these things to take place. I feel like I could be doing more than I am but I would like that to be taken into account for data purposes. Could have used some kind of a N/A option. Anyway:  /  / Answering these questions is hard to do in this format because there's what's conceptually possible to imagine (racial justice) and then there's the obstacles to that in reality (a lot of wealth and power backing institutional racism). Is it possible to get there from here? I'd like to hope so. I'm not a very optimistic person but I think it's worth trying for it anyway."
