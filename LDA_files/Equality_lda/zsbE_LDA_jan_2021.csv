This is the only way they can move up.  I am from a low income family.  I lived in low income housing.  I managed to put my self through school with Federal grants and get a degree.  I worked hard in my job to get where I am now.  It is possible but it required work.

Without interrogating and changing the culture of an institution that benefits from and is built to support white wealth and systemic racism, ableism, sexism, etc, the institution will not retain the diverse groups and will actively harm those groups. I think there is a lot of dismantling that needs to go on inside organizations before they can become a place of equity and inclusion."
