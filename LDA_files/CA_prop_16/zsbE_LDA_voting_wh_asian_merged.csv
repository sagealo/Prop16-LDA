R_cYqmOkiodY1SWid,5eb30f3df0b5800d9933b806,white,I support Proposition 16 because it gives minorities a better chance at succeeding. For many minorities there are many outside factors that impede on their success. Helping alleviate is necessary if we want to give everyone an equal chance.

R_1ln1V2h1xz9EE08,5f29bcd6a340af13ed199faa,white,I think that this is a good thing because it allows companies to specifically seek employees of a certain racial or ethnic background. This may allow for greater representation in the workplace.

R_XiVMjswc7OB2wdb,5eaeeb288d10425b584e730a,white,This is a form of racism and decriminalization. California had affirmative action and it was outlawed several years ago for a reason. There is no reason to bring affirmative action back because it was shown to be an ineffective policy.

This proposition allows for more diverse hires that may not meet traditional 'qualifications'.   I have found that in hiring some of the qualifications are not related to being good at that job but related to being a culture fit and maintaining the status quo and so many women or POC's don't fit.  Ideally, this wouldn't be required in order to have a representative workforce, but given the way society is structured today, we need adjustments to push for equity.  "

R_30pB9GiYV2KPMwR,5e0d256753e8464d64940925,white,I support it because it gives under represented groups a fair shot. Hiring is already tilted in favor of white males. This simply tries to level the playing field a bit.
