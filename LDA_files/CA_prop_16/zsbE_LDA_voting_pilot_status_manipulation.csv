If minorities aren't getting the jobs they want, they need to educate themselves properly and work for the job they want. I don't believe the whole 'they went through generations of problems they don't have the money' excuse. They offer scholarships just for minorities, yet there is no such thing for a white person. Seems like a minority privilege if you ask me... but moving on... We should ask ourselves why more diversity would make the workforce a better place. It most certainly wouldn't is the answer. This is because jobs should be delegated based on relatable skilled qualifications only, regardless of race. If we start handing out jobs based on the way people look, then we're passing up those who are truly most qualified. This is going to hurt efficiency and cost us countless dollars, so the part above about 'no fiscal impact' is absolute bullshit and frankly ignorant. What it really boils down to is that the minorities need to stop having a pity party for themselves and get to work. I'm a white male, and I've never experienced the white male privilege I hear about. I've worked for everything I've owned, was given nothing by my parents, paid my own way out of my pocket through the part of college I completed with no loans or debt by starting to work after school at 16, and endured reverse-racism from a white hating manager who was black at one of my first real jobs. In addition, I overcame homelessness at one point in my life, and never once was offered anything beneficial for the color of my skin or sex and never had to beg to get myself back on my feet because I did any kind of work I could. Getting myself out of that situation was extremely rewarding and taught me self-reliance and made me realize that the majority of excuses you hear today are just that, excuses. So in conclusion, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to vote such a stupid proposition in, and it shows how shitty this world has become with a bunch of whiners who don't want to work for anything. I wish our country would tell them as my parents told me, ""If you don't like it, don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out""."

So, we give them jobs they aren't qualified for or send them to Universities like Harvard where the entrance exams are easier yet the workload is the same and they fail because they don't have the education or skills to do the job or keep up with the school work. So what happens? They quit their jobs, get fired, drop out of school and go right back to where they were before...poor, uneducated, unskilled, out of work and on public assistance.

An employer could not exclude someone because they were black, gay or so on.  The overturning of this restriction will only set us back 50 years.  Sure, in today's environment when it is popular promote all sorts of so-call minorities, we can envision a workplace where all are represented.  However, as soon as the gay, black or atheist bandwagon loses traction, people will have a ready made reason to start excluding minorities by legal matters.  Believe me people living where I do in the Bible Belt would love to have a legal right to ask if a person is gay or non-christian.  In general, the proposition is short-sided.   "

R_2b4cLRMXxek6Av4,5c832bd24b0de2001b3510fc,Oppose because race or sex or any thing else shouldn't determine whether they get a job or a position.
R_3iDWZozQB1Nvwqi,5a4ffbc076d1c60001aa9438,I support this proposition because more minorities would get hired in jobs than they previously would not have.
R_3MajjkZcbzTr5cq,5dc1e2c9880a29158c594ba2,"I oppose this. I think this will favor minorities because people will want to hire minorities to help them out. It shouldn't be this way. Hiring should be done based on the most qualified candidate, regardless of their race, age, sex, etc."

R_1je1iMBwJ932nGR,5f26a21c70a6d23f6032b1ea,I feel that the decision making policies for this could hinder just as much as help the groups effected. The basis for this policy that people consider should not be the determining factor but rather on the merit or individual themselves.

Race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin should have absolutely no bearing on any sort of decision in this country. The fact that we even consider these differences to be ""necessary"" in how we make policy is absolutely disgusting, as we should all be equal for everything."
